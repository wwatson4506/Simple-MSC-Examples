# Simple-MSC-Examples

These are some simple examples of using USBHost_t36 and USB drives and TD1.59 - TD 1.60B3.

In the "copyFilesUSB" you will find the zipped file that gets copied all over the place (32MEGfile.dat.zip).

Unzip this file. 

This file must be copied to one of the USB drives or the SD drive. Preferably USB drive 1 or all of them.

There are probably bugs!!
