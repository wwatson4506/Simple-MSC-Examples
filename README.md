# Simple-MSC-Examples

These are some simple examples of using USBHost_t36 and USB drives and TD1.59 - TD 1.60B3.

Copy this library to your local Arduino sketchbook to use.They will only be seen in the sketchbook.

In the "copyFilesUSB" you will find the zipped file that gets copied all over the place (32MEGfile.dat.zip).

Unzip this file. 

This file must be copied to one of the USB drives or the SD drive. Preferably USB drive 1 or all of them.

The bench.ino examples gives a good indication of read/write speed of a particular USB drive.

The copyFilesUSB.ino sketch shows transfer speeds when coping a 32meg file from one device to another.

There are probably bugs!!

# Use these examples at your own risk. No gaurantees given.
